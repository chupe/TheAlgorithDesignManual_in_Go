Hello there,

My name is Adnan and the repo serves as record of my first attempts at Go.

The idea is to write Go code for some (if not all) of the algorithms I come across in the book
'The Algorithm Design Manual, 3rd edition' by Steven Skiena in hopes of getting more intimately familiar with the
concepts explained in the book, as well as writing Go code.
My solutions are far from perfect, hence the value in writing them down - self-improvement over time.

The code is roughly divided by name of book chapters.
